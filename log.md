# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Pomodoro App from the FreeCodeCamp Challenge. 

**Thoughts:** Today I animated the background color to fill up on click. Now the next step is to add the functionality to start/pause the transition on click.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I tried to implement the countdown timer, but implemented just the session timer (considering its in seconds).

**Thoughts:** Not much progress today. Tomorrow I will try to implement the countdown timer functionality so that it starts the break after session is completed.
